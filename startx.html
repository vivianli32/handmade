        <div class="wide-text-div">
            <p class="wide-text">Summer 2015 internship at StartX. I had the responsibility of completely redesigning and restructuring the website.
                This included branding, user research, design, content, and coding challenges wrapped into one, and proved to an invaluable
                toe-dipping experience into each field. All I was told at the beginning of the internship was that the website
                "really, really needed a makeover" and that I had near autonomy in my decisions.
                From there I set about identifying the specific IA, UX, and visual errors that were troubling everyone.</p>

    <!--PHASE 1-->
    <div class="phase" id="startx-phase1"> 
        <p class="phase-title-center">Phase 1: User interviews and research on competitors</p>
        <hr width="10%">
        <div class="col1-div">
            <p class="col1-title">User interviews</p>
            <p class="col1">I sat down with our primary users to watch them navigate 
                through the website and verbalize their thoughts. This helped me hone in on what was making the UX
                frustrating for people, and to come up with a priority list of issues to focus on during the design phase.</p>
                <div class="emphasis-box" id="startx-user-interviews-findings">
                    <p class="emphasis-box-text">
                        <b>Findings:</b><br>Through these interviews, I figured out that the primary problems with the old website were<br></p>
                        <ol><li>illogical information organization, and</li><br>
                        <li>outdated, stiff visuals,</li></ol>
                    <p class="emphasis-box-text" id="user-interviews-after-ol">
                        leading to frustrating user experience and negative impressions. Our primary users, SV startup founders, are
                        some of the people most familiar with good design, so the StartX website was falling far below expectations. </p>

        <div class="col2-div">
            <p class="col2-title">Research on competitors</p>
            <p class="col2">I moved on to research competing accelerators and incubators. 500, YC, were a few that I studied closely 
                to understand visitor expectations, to see how competitors were advertising themselves, and helped me strategize on 
                ways to distinguish StartX from the rest. I also looked at university sites like <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>
                and <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/">Stanford GSB</a> to sense web trends for educational institutions,
                since StartX is presents itself as an <b>educational</b> non-profit accelerator.<br>

                    <p class="emphasis-box-text">
                        <b>Findings:</b><br>
                        Thorough discussion with my project manager lead us to decide on an educational, honest, earthy "feel" that mixed 
                        both the startup accelerator and school styles.</p>

    <!--PHASE 2-->
    <div class="phase" id="startx-phase2">

        </div>
        <div class="col1-div">
            <p class="col1">This design phase consisted of three steps: paper sketches, wireframes, and high fidelity mockups.<br>
                <b>In the paper sketch step,</b> I brought together the results of my research and interviews, went through two iterations, and 
                post them up to make a paper prototype. I grabbed a few founders to get their quick opinion on progress so far, and kept the 
                critique in mind for the next step.<br>
                <b>In the wireframing step,</b> I translated my paper sketches into a clean digital form for future reference. On it, I noted 
                animated behaviors I'd like for the final website, explanation for items, etc. This was a quick step as I did not treat wireframing
                in the traditional way.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col2-div">
            <p class="col2"><b>In the high fidelity stage,</b> I resorted to my trusty old friend, Adobe Illustrator. I'm highly familiar with
                the program, making it an efficient tool of choice. Taking in design motifs from various educational websites, as well as a previously
                agreed-upon color scheme, I created a series of hifi prototypes, an example of which can be viewed in the image carousel.</p><br>

        <div class="wide-text-div">
            <p class="wide-text">In this phase, I worked closely with webdev StartX intern <a href="http://integralhero.github.io/">
                David Jiang</a> to craft the frontend. Unfortunately, due to the limited duration of my internship, I was not able to
                make my website go live. My design and website are currently being continued by the organization, hence the current StartX 
                    <a href="http://startx.stanford.edu">website</a> is <b>not</b> my work.<br><br>
                Our approach included:
                <ol id="startx-phase3-ol"><li>HTML/Bootstrap skeletons</li><li>Agreeing upon CSS classes, names, IDs, etc.</li><li>Styling, images, fonts</li>

                    <li style="margin:0 0 10px 0;"><b>A quick grasp</b> of what users are saying about your product, at the very beginning of the process, is good enough. While the thorough interviews I did were helpful, time was more important than thoroughness in this case.<br></li>
                    <li style="margin:0 0 10px 0;"><b>User-watch</b> next time to avoid biases in feedback-- actions are indicative of how they feel and how they're reacting to the product.

                    <li style="margin:0 0 10px 0;"><b>Collecting more feedback</b> to help drive changes in each iterations. I found myself asking myself what "worked" more than I should have, when truthfully I am designing for the startup founder.<br></li>
                    <li style="margin:0 0 10px 0;"><b>Don't be afraid to ask for help.</b> I already asked a lot of questions to my PM and the web dev intern I worked closely with, but even then I felt myself holding back. I could only do better if I reached out more.<br></li>
                    <li style="margin:0 0 10px 0;">With more efficient use of time in earlier steps, <b>conduct A/B tests for design decisions you can't decide on your own.</b><br></li>
                    <li><b>I gained a fine-tuned sense of aesthetic.</b> There are even more iterations that I did not upload due to lack of space, but I learned quickly what looks good and what doesn't.</li>
