                Prior to attending Tradecraft (more on that later), I read the book <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-User-Experience-User-Centered-Design/dp/0321683684/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470679772&sr=8-1&keywords=the+elements+of+user+experience">"The Elements of User Experience"</a> by Jesse James Garrett with the intention on brushing up on old knowledge. Garrett provides a strong metaphor for the UX process, reminiscent of my old geometry textbook illustrations. I won't dive into the details of the metaphor, but instead attempt to synthesize new insights on the book and stir discussion.<br><br>

Here's my biggest takeaway from the book: the UX process is one that builds up from the foundations of strategy to externality of visuals. However it maintains flexibility in both directions--important decisions at any level ripple to the rest, resulting in a fine-tuned product that serves the interests of the user and the business in the most efficient, sensible, and delightful way. If you think differently, let me know and shoot me an <a target="_blank" href="mailto:vivianli32@gmail.com">email</a>! <br><br>

As in every book, there are certain elements that the author excels at, and other aspects that offer wiggle room for improvement. I'll start with my praise: Garrett's metaphor and explanations do an excellent job of painting a big picture about the UX process, which tends to be rather fuzzy and difficult to grasp for newcomers and non-designers. By introducing and explaining by a concrete model, we've got something to lean on and learn from. One particularly elegant section described the necessary balance between the business and the consumer, achieved through research and compromise. This, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=designers+should+know+business+medium&oq=designers+should+know+business+medium+&aqs=chrome..69i57.4156j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">cries</a> from many design writers, lead me to believe that a designer should understand the business half of their work. (Whether or not they should start or stop coding, is another rabbit hole I won't get into here) <br><br>

In his mission to deliver a high-level understanding to readers, however, the details toward the end of the chapters are extremely dry and hard to retain. The subsections feel like a laundry list of items to slog through, heave in and out of our small-capacity short-term memory buckets. Unless you make a concerted effort to take notes, you disengage. In addition, as Garrett has made clear, this is not a book to model your next UX project after--the metaphor is too structured, too clean, too idealistic, to be a UX process formula. The meetings, conversations, and situation-specific decisions made in practice blur the lines between the planes, and make following a theoretical process impractical.<br><br>

Whether or not you've read this book, here's my suggestion: read it to enrich your theoretical understanding of the UX process, but don't use it as a procedural model for your next UX project.
